### To install

1. Create and activate a virtual environment. Use Python3 as the interpreter. Suggest locating the venv/ directory outside of the code directory.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

### Create superuser

`python manage.py createsuperuser`

enter username and password

will be able to use these to log into admin console at

127.0.0.1:8000/admin


### Run tests

To run tests  (some currently fail - see Issues)

```
python manage.py test lmn.tests
```

Or just some of the tests,

```
python manage.py test lmn.tests.test_views
python manage.py test lmn.tests.test_views.TestUserAuthentication
python manage.py test lmn.tests.test_views.TestUserAuthentication.test_user_registration_logs_user_in
```


### Functional Tests with Selenium

Make sure you have the latest version of Chrome or Firefox, and the most recent chromedriver or geckodriver, and latest Selenium.

chromedriver/geckodriver needs to be in path or you need to tell Selenium where it is. Pick an approach: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/40208051/selenium-using-python-geckodriver-executable-needs-to-be-in-path

If your DB is hosted at Elephant, your tests might time out, and you might need to use longer waits http://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/waits.html

Run tests with

```
python manage.py test lmn.tests.functional_tests
```

Or select tests, for example,
```
python manage.py test lmn.tests.functional_tests.HomePageTest
python manage.py test lmn.tests.functional_tests.BrowseArtists.test_searching_artists
```


### Test coverage

From directory with manage.py in it,

```
coverage run --source='.' manage.py test lmn.tests
coverage report
```


### PostgreSQL

Recommend using PaaS Postgres such as Elephant, instead of installing local Postgres.
